# Doxyfile 1.12.0

# This file describes the settings to be used by the documentation system
# Doxygen (www.doxygen.org) for a project.
#
# All text after a double hash (##) is considered a comment and is placed in
# front of the TAG it is preceding.
#
# All text after a single hash (#) is considered a comment and will be ignored.
# The format is:
# TAG = value [value, ...]
# For lists, items can also be appended using:
# TAG += value [value, ...]
# Values that contain spaces should be placed between quotes (\" \").
#
# Note:
#
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file:
# doxygen -x [configFile]
# Use Doxygen to compare the used configuration file with the template
# configuration file without replacing the environment variables or CMake type
# replacement variables:
# doxygen -x_noenv [configFile]

# This tag specifies the encoding used for all characters in the configuration
# file that follow. The default is UTF-8 which is also the encoding used for all
# text before the first occurrence of this tag. Doxygen uses libiconv (or the
# iconv built into libc) for the transcoding. See
# https://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/ for the list of possible encodings.
# The default value is: UTF-8.

DOXYFILE_ENCODING      = UTF-8

# The PROJECT_NAME tag is a single word (or a sequence of words surrounded by
# double-quotes, unless you are using Doxywizard) that should identify the
# project for which the documentation is generated. This name is used in the
# title of most generated pages and in a few other places.
# The default value is: My Project.

PROJECT_NAME           = "Nothofagus"

# INPUT: Set the directories or files where the source code is located. This 
# should point to the directory or files containing AnimatedBellota, 
# AnimationState, AnimationStateMachine, and their respective headers.
INPUT = ./src ./include  # Adjust according to your project structure

# FILE_PATTERNS: Ensure that .cpp and .h files are included (or other relevant 
# file extensions):
FILE_PATTERNS = *.cpp *.h

# EXTRACT_ALL: Set Doxygen to document everything
EXTRACT_ALL = YES

# OUTPUT_DIRECTORY: Directory where the generated documentation will be stored
OUTPUT_DIRECTORY = ./docs

# GENERATE_LATEX: Don’t need LaTeX documentation (for PDF generation), setted
# this to NO to speed up the process
GENERATE_LATEX = NO
